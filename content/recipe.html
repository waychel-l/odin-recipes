            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pre-heat oven to 160 degrees Celsius (fan setting).</li>
                    <li>Chop the courgettes and peel the garlic.</li>
                    <li>Add them plus the olive oil, salt and pepper into an ovenproof dish for which you have a lid. Toss and assemble so the fleshy side is face down.</li>
                    <li>Slow cook for 35-40 min.</li>
                    <li>Remove the lid and cook for 10-15 mins more until slightly browning on top.</li>
                    <li>Remove and squish down with a fork. You can drain some of the oil and reserve for garnish if you wish.</li>
                    <li>Add the butterbeans, their juice, 2 tablespoons of the cashew cream and gently stir together. No need to heat. Too with the nutty breadcrumb mix, basil and enjoy.</li>
                </ol>
